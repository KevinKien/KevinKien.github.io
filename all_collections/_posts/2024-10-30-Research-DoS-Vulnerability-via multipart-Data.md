About DoS vulnerability, this is vulnerability will causing system disruption, with upload via multipart/data hacker will upload large file to application. System when process large file will inscrease cpu and mem causing system disruption. 

# Scenario 1: DoS via file upload

import uvicorn
import os

app = FastAPI()

UPLOAD_DIR = "./uploads"
os.makedirs(UPLOAD_DIR, exist_ok=True)

@app.post("/upload/")
async def upload_file(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    # Đọc và lưu file tải lên
    try:
        file_location = os.path.join(UPLOAD_DIR, file.filename)
        with open(file_location, "wb") as buffer:
            buffer.write(await file.read())
        return {"filename": file.filename}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Error saving file")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
